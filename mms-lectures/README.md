## Lectures

### An Introduction To Mathematical Notation: Preface

The aim of this lecture was for attendees to familiarise themselves with
mathematical notation. The aim is not a rigorous treatment of the subject of
proofs and theorem proving, nor is it designed to build fluency in calculation.
Rather, the focus was developing familiarity with the language of mathematics.
